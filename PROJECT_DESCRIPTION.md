# Prism - Educational Design System

## Overview
Prism is an open-source design system built specifically for educational purposes. The goal is to teach developers how to build their own bespoke design systems by providing a clear, well-documented example with inline explanations of architectural decisions.

## Target Audience
- Developers who want to learn how design systems work
- Teams planning to build their own custom design system
- Students studying UI/UX engineering and component architecture
- Contributors interested in design system development

## Key Differentiators
Unlike production design systems (Material-UI, Ant Design, IBM Carbon, Mantine), Prism:
1. Prioritizes clarity and simplicity over features
2. Includes extensive inline documentation explaining "why" behind decisions
3. Progressive complexity - start simple, build up understanding
4. Teaches the full stack: tokens → components → theming → a11y → distribution

## Tech Stack
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Build**: tsup (esbuild)
- **Docs**: Storybook
- **Versioning**: Changesets

## Project Status
🚧 **In active development** - Initial setup complete, building core components and documentation.
