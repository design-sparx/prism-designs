/**
 * Prism Design Tokens
 *
 * Design tokens are the foundational building blocks of a design system.
 * They represent design decisions as data (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
 * that can be shared across platforms and updated in one place.
 *
 * This is where your design system's single source of truth begins.
 *
 * Token Categories:
 * - borderRadius: Rounded corner values
 * - borderWidth: Border thickness values
 * - colors: Color palette (primary, neutral, semantic)
 * - shadows: Elevation and depth values
 * - sizes: Component dimensions and widths
 * - spacing: Layout spacing scale
 * - transitions: Animation timing and easing
 * - typography: Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
